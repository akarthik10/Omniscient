Omniscient is a PHP based web application that can answer user queries instantly. It consults other web APIs to determine the result accurately for the user query. It answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data obtained from online APIs, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine might.
You require a Wolfram|Alpha developer API key to get started.
